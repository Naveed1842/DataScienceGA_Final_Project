    "1. What's the project about? What problem are you solving?\n",
    "Answer : The project is about predicting high value rides based on pickup location, day of the week and time. Using this prediction model, the taxi drivers can be better located at places where there is a good probability of getting a high value ride and a high demand for rides."

    "Answer: Since the project is to predict a continuous variable, linear regression analysis will be used. A classification model can be used to further analyze whether the pickup location generates high value rides or not."
